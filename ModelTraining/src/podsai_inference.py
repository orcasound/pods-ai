        Run inference on a wav file using sliding window.

        Uses a sliding window approach with configurable segment and hop duration to match
        the orcahello LiveInferenceOrchestrator behavior. Unlike FastAIModel which uses a
        1-second hop and produces per-second outputs, this implementation uses a configurable
        hop_duration (default 2 seconds) for efficiency.

        The timestamp correction logic in extract_training_samples.py automatically adapts
        by inferring hop_duration = audio_duration / len(local_confidences), so the different
        output length is handled transparently.

        Args:
            wav_path: Path to wav file (typically 60 seconds long)
            segment_duration: Duration of each segment in seconds (default: 3)
            hop_duration: Hop size in seconds between segments (default: 2)
                         With hop_duration=2, a 60s audio produces ~29 confidence values.
                         With hop_duration=1, a 60s audio produces ~58 confidence values (matching FastAI).
            threshold: Confidence threshold for positive (non-other) predictions (default: use instance value)
            min_num_positive_calls_threshold: Minimum positive predictions for global positive classification.

                                             Default: use instance value (typically 3).

        Returns:
            Dictionary with keys:
                - local_predictions: List of class IDs for each hop_duration interval.
                                    Length = floor((audio_duration - segment_duration) / hop_duration) + 1

                                    Computed as 1 - P(negative classes). Used by timestamp correction
                                    to identify the most likely position of whale calls.
                                    local_confidences[i] represents the score at time offset
                                    i * hop_duration seconds from the start.
